<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is <a href="/">Aritra Chakrabarty </a>, and I am an Indian Astrophysicist working
    as a Postdoc at the <a href="https://dataobservatory.net/team"> Data Observatory </a> and
    <a href="https://physics-astro.uai.cl/team/"> Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez </a> in Santiago, Chile. My research primarily focuses on bridging the formation
    and evolution pathways of small exoplanets with their observed demographics. My work involves statistical modeling and numerical simulations. I
    also work on radiative transfer in atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs using numerical techniques. Utilizing these models, I generate
    captivating simulations of spectra, phase curves, and polarization observable from such astronomical objects.
